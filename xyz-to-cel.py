"""
This module reads files in .xyz format.  This file can also be run as a script to convert xyz files
into several other formats.  Currently supported formats are csv and cel.

If you are unfamiliar with command line programs, run the command:
    'python xyz-to-cel.py --help'
in a command prompt in the same directory as this file.

This is early-version software!  There are very likely bugs.  Make sure to take a look at your
output files and ensure they make sense.  If you encounter bugs, please open an issue on GitHub.

The comments in this file mention several planned features.  The version of this program hosted on
this repository is unlikely to see feature updates; message the author if you want to inquire about
newer versions.
